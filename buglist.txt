Known bugs:

isEmpty() always returns true.
addBack() adds to the front.
removeFront() and removeBack() currently do not remove anything.

My guess is that the remove functions do not work because they are 
relying on the isEmpty() function, which is broken. Similarly, it
may be the case that addBack() is relying on isEmpty() to determine
if it should add to the back if the function returns false or to add 
to the front if it returns true.
